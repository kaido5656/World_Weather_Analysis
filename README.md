# World_Weather_Analysis
### Purpose
  The purpose of this repository was to assist Jack with a PlanMyTrip application, using pandas and most notably APIs. The initial version of the code and app was loved by beta testers and Jack alike, however they have recommended some some suggestions to improve it all together. The following features were refactored or added to the base code to improve upon it:
  1. Retreve weather data from cities using gmaps
  2. Create a customer travel destinations map based on temperature preferences 
  3. Create a travel itinerary map based on 4 cities chosen by a user.
